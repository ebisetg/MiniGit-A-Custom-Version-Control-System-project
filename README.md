# MiniGit: A Custom Version Control System

## 📌 Project Overview

MiniGit is a lightweight, Git-inspired version control system built from scratch using C++. It simulates core Git functionalities like tracking file changes, commits, branching, merging, and viewing history — all through a command-line interface. This project helps students understand how real-world version control tools work by applying key Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) principles such as hashing, trees, DAGs, and file diffing.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Design and implement complex data structures (e.g., DAGs, trees).
- Understand the internal workings of Git.
- Improve file I/O handling and CLI application development.
- Write modular, scalable, and maintainable code.
- Apply software engineering practices: versioning, diffing, merging.

## 🚀 Key Features

| Feature                              | Description                                                          |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `init`                               | Initializes a `.minigit/` directory and sets up tracking structures. |
| `add <filename>`                     | Stages files for commit; hashes file content and stores blobs.       |
| `commit -m "<message>"`              | Saves a snapshot with metadata, parent link, and file references.    |
| `log`                                | Displays commit history from HEAD with hashes and messages.          |
| `branch <name>`                      | Creates a new branch pointing to the current commit.                 |
| `checkout <branch/commit>`           | Switches working directory to the specified state.                   |
| `merge <branch>`                     | Merges changes between branches, resolving conflicts.                |
| `diff <commit1> <commit2>` _(Bonus)_ | Displays line-by-line differences between two commits.               |

## 📂 Internal Data Structures

| Component            | Purpose                        | DSA Concepts     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| **Blob**             | Stores content of a file       | Hashing, I/O     |
| **Commit Node**      | Stores metadata and blob links | DAG, Linked List |
| **Branch Reference** | Maps branch names to commits   | HashMap          |
| **Staging Area**     | Tracks added files             | Set, Hash Table  |
| **Log History**      | Tracks commit chain            | Linked List      |
