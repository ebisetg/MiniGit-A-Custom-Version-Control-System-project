# MiniGit-A-Custom-Version-Control-System-project
MiniGit is a lightweight, local-only version control system built from scratch. It tracks file changes, supports commits, branching, merging, and log history using DSA concepts like hashing, trees, DAGs, and file diffing â€” all via a simple command-line interface without external libraries.
